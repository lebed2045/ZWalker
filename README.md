# ZWalker
---------
Program for walking robot base of Luminary Micro LM3S811 Evaluation Kit (ARM Cortex M3), servos towerpro mg90.

It was my university project supervised by Zapunidi Sergey from Laboratory of photophysics of organic materials of Lomonosov State University.

Unfortunately, I was stupid enough to do not record video when I finished the robot, so the only evidence I have the old video while I first launched it. So it was kind of first, tentative steps of Zwalker and it walked far better in all future test, especially after I've changed plastic servos to the metal one. Also it controled by bluetooth. https://youtu.be/565xqV6W3Kk
